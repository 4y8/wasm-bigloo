# Features to add
Here are some features that should be added to watib:
+ Compatibility with wasm-as for things such as undeclared function references
  or adding unreachable
+ Binary files parsing
+ Dead code elminiation with a wasm-metadce like interface. The input file could
  be given information like purity/execptions it can raise
