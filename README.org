* watib
Watib (WebAssembly Toolchain In Bigloo) is a (WIP) WebAssembly toolchain. It
focuses on being user friendly and fast.

** Building
To build watib, a working [[https://www-sop.inria.fr/indes/fp/Bigloo/][bigloo]] distribution is required. You can, then, build it with:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
make
#+END_SRC
** Using
Once built, ~watib~ can be called on a WebAssembly Text file to validate,
optimise and convert it to binary format. It supports several options:
+ ~-o <file>~ to specify an output file,
+ ~-k~ or ~--keep-going~ to continue validation after an error has been
  encoutered (won't produce an output file),
+ ~-j <n>~ to use more than one job.
** Overview
+ The ~Val~ directory contains the validation logic. In particular, the
  ~instruction-types.sch~ file contains the descritption of the type of most
  instructions.
